# Welcome to my...✨GitHub Page✨

I am a **Full-Stack Software Engineer** hailing from the scenic coastal city of Savannah, Georgia. 🌅🏝️🌊⛵🦐🐠🐙🐬🐚🩴

🧩 My professional interests are rooted in **Back-End Engineering** and **Data Engineering**. I thrive on the challenges these fields offer, from constructing robust and efficient server-side architectures to unraveling complex data puzzles. In particular, I have a keen interest in exploring API documentations(!) and enjoy uncovering the secrets and potentials hidden behind each key, delving into the depths of accessible information. Alongside this, I also have a growing interest in machine learning and data science concepts.

🎨 At the same time, I am adept in **Front-End Development** which enables me to create seamless, user-friendly interfaces to complement back-end systems. This skill set allows me to bridge the gap between server and client-side, integrating functionality with aesthetics for a cohesive user experience.

⚙️ I am deeply committed to delivering an end-to-end experience in my applications, ensuring they are as efficient and reliable on the inside as they are intuitive and appealing on the outside.

## 🔎 What sets me apart?

🌈 **My interdisciplinary background and my long-held interest in the nexus of technology and creativity.** 🌈 

🦄 I hold an **M.S. in Digital Media, specializing in UX Design, from Georgia Tech**, and in June 2023, I completed **Hackbright Academy's immersive software engineering fellowship**. This diverse educational journey enables me to tackle coding challenges with an approach that seamlessly **integrates technical acumen with creative problem-solving**-- a rare and valuable perspective in the industry.

💼 Before pivoting into tech, I garnered a variety of experiences working in freelance creative roles, primarily with academic and startup companies. These positions ranged from copywriting and scriptwriting to content creation and UX/UI design, further enriching my skillset and understanding of diverse professional environments.
